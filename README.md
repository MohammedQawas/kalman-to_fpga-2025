Kalman Filter-Based Motion Artifact Reduction on FPGA
This project aims to reduce motion artifact noise  by evaluating different adaptive filtering algorithms and implementing the best solution on an FPGA.
After testing multiple adaptive filters in MATLAB — including LMS, NLMS, and variants — the Kalman Filter was selected for its superior performance in maintaining signal quality while removing noise.

Highlights
1.MATLAB-based evaluation of multiple adaptive algorithms
2.Kalman Filter chosen for FPGA implementation due to accuracy & stability
3.Hardware design optimized for real-time processing with minimal resource usage
4.Supports fixed-point arithmetic for FPGA efficiency

Applications
1.Any system affected by motion-induced noise
